# nsxt-bulk-group-add
This project has been created to take CSV files that have been created through outputs within vRealize Network Insight to create a group structure that will match the importation of distributed firewall rules. It is the intention that this application will be enhanced over time to allow for a more automated workflow of rule creation through vRNI.
