If the grouping object includes more than certain number of IP addresses, the redundant parts would be ignored and those IP addresses would not be treated as pool members. If the size is not specified, one member is budgeted for this dynamic pool so that the pool has at least one member even if some other dynamic pools grow beyond the capacity of load balancer service. Other members are picked according to available dynamic capacity. The unused members would be set to DISABLED so that the load balancer system itself is not overloaded during runtime.
